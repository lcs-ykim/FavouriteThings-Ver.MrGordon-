      details: """
                Just under three years ago, my family welcomed a new member to our pack: Piper!

                Piper as a puppy packed a lot of pep! She was full of energy. While we were fortunate that she never showed much interest in chewing the furniture – something young Labradors are known for – she had no such compunction about my ankles. There was a period when she was about 10 weeks old where I would only go in the kitchen – the part of the house she was limited to at first – when wearing knee high rainboots. Protection. 😅

                My family thinks Piper at any age was adorable, but as a puppy she definitely had her moments. A favourite memory is watching Piper chew a stick with her "best friend"... the yellow Labrador who lives next door and is about five years older than Piper.

                These days Piper has slowed down a bit (she loves to sleep on our couch) but when she goes out for a walk (often at Northcote) she will tear around with complete abandon.

                We love Piper very much. 🥰

      details: """
                Growing up in Kitchener-Waterloo, I spent a lot of time with family that lived in areas nearby. My Aunt Phyllis and Uncle Bert in particular introduced me to baseball – or more specificially – Blue Jays baseball!

                Lloyd Moseby, Dave Stieb, George Bell, Ernie Whitt... these were the Blue Jays of my youth. The sound of Tom Cheek and Jerry Howarth calling a game on the radio was the background to many summer days.

                More recently I lived in downtown Toronto during the Blue Jays big runs of 2015 and 2016. I was in the Rogers Centre for Jose Bautista's "bat flip" home run, which is a moment I will never forget.

                I now have many fond memories of bringing my own daughter, Claire, to Blue Jays games as she grew up. Once the pandemic is over, I am looking forward to getting back out to ballgames with my friends and family.

      heroImage: "Cheesecake",
      details: """
    I am well known in my family for my love of cheesecake. Whenever we would eat out at a restaurant as I was growing up, if we stayed for dessert, the first thing I would look for on the menu is cheesecake.

    First things first: "supermarket cheesecake" is not real cheesecake. Sorry, Sara Lee.

    What makes a good cheesecake? First, the filling. It shouldn't taste like a block of cheese... but it should also not be light, like a cream pie. There is a happy medium.

    Second, the crust. A cheesecake's crust should be thick, with a good amount of crumble and no small amount of brown sugar. Not too hard, but defintely not soggy.

    Finally, I like to compare apples to apples. The classic "New York style" cheesecake is best. Variants like chocolate cheesecake are OK, but my own preference is to stick with the standard.
